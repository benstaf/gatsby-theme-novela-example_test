excerpt: To reduce failure in development of CAR T cells for solid tumors, an idea is to feed clinical data back from bedside to bench.

Cancer drug development is very risky. The pipeline suffers from a lot of attrition: [only 3.4% of human-tested oncology drugs](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxx069) reach the market. It means **96.6% fail**. To reduce failure, one idea is to feed clinical data back into early drug development, **from bedside to bench.**

That’s what I did in my last paper. I fed back a predictive model, trained on 73 human cancer studies, into the pre-clinical development of a CAR T cell therapy for solid tumors:

[**CAR T cells for solid tumors: genome-wide dysfunction signature confirms value of c-Jun overexpression, but signals heterogeneity - bioRxiv**  
](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.07.939033 "https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.07.939033")
  

### What is CAR T cell therapy?

CAR T cells are an emerging therapy tweaking immune T cells with Chimeric Antigen Receptors (CAR), so that they become **fast, furious and focused** on tumors:

  CAR T therapies are already approved in few liquid cancers, since 2017. They are marketed as **Kymriah** and **Yescarta**, with furious prices, up to **$475,000** per patient.

On the other hand, CAR T therapies still fail in solid cancers, partly because once inside tumors, CAR T cells get **exhausted** too quickly. CAR T cells are sprinters, but fighting cancer is a marathon. By being too fast & too furious, they burn-out.

### “Exhaustion-resistant” JUN CAR T cells

To overcome exhaustion, Crystal Mackall’s lab, at Stanford Center for Cancer Cell Therapy, engineered CAR T cells to **over-express c-Jun protein**, coded by the **JUN gene**. They [published a paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1805-z).


CAR T cells become stronger indeed, but at the end, improvement is modest: they were only able to extend survival of cancerous mice by **20 days**:

After 50 days, the fate of surviving mice is unknown. I hope the final cell therapy will guarantee longer survival, because with an expected price of half-Million dollar per therapy, the cost of 1 year of life extension will be $8 Million. Market regulators around the world often reject cancer drugs that are much cheaper.

To monitor CAR T cells health and activity, Mackall’s team relies on several **single-gene biomarkers** of exhaustion. For example, they measure expression levels of PDCD1, TIGIT and TOX genes. With these uni-dimensional indicators, everything seems fine indeed. However, if we consider advanced genome-wide biomarkers, designed for tumor micro-environment monitoring, the picture is a bit different.

### Clinical data feedback with TIDE dysfunction biomarker

I applied the dysfunction biomarker TID (Tumor Immune Dysfunction), a component of TIDE (Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion), developed by Xiaole Shirley Liu’s lab, at Harvard Cancer Center. TID is a predictive model trained on **73 human cancer studies**, aggregating tens of thousands of samples. TID combines a lot of late-stage clinical data.

TIDE was initially designed with another immunotherapy in mind: immune checkpoint inhibitors. These immunotherapies also often fail because of T cells exhaustion. However, TIDE relies on general survival data, so it makes sense to re-purpose this predictive model for CAR T cells therapies.

### “Exhaustion-resistant” JUN CAR T cells vs. TIDE dysfunction biomarker

When we confront “exhaustion-resistant” JUN CAR T cells, and TIDE dysfunction biomarker (TID), what happens?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Ll4AFIQKD6S1lqBh2IOpBQ.jpeg)

**Good news**: TIDE dysfunction biomarker, TID, confirms that on average, JUN CAR T cells are less dysfunctional (their difference with non-JUN cells is negative):

**Bad news**: TID also reveals that JUN CAR T cells are heterogeneous. This was not apparent with single-gene biomarkers:

TID cell variance in purple, single-gene variances in yellow.

Heterogeneity is very bad in cancer: it brings opportunities for tumor resistance.

For further investigation, one possibility is to look at low-dysfunctional JUN CAR T cells in detail. They cluster at the tip of 2-D cell projection, and that’s remarkable:

### Conclusion

If I was a decision-maker, I would request additional experiments, data and analysis. For example, if I was CEO of Lyell Immunopharma (the Stanford spin-off), or a biotech Venture Capitalist, I would ask for de-risking JUN CAR T cells further, before investing in a clinical trial. It’s better to nail down the pre-clinical phase, before moving forward.

Of course, there are several caveats: tumor resistance, if any, didn’t have enough time to show up within a limited 50-days mouse experiment. Moreover, Mackall’s team did not publish tumor cells data, only CAR T cells data. I am supposing heterogeneity is related in both cell types. Finally, TIDE biomarker also has uncertainty (see [my paper](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.07.939033) for details).

Anyway, that’s an exciting project, and if you want to play with the code and data, it’s available upon request at [Melwy.com](https://melwy.com). I prepared a hands-on tutorial, with a lot of exercises.

I also recommend you to join other fascinating projects about Cancer & Data Science, I organize [Telegram](https://t.me/joinchat/Go4mTxRr9Tbx53S_w-0-vQ) and [Slack groups](https://join.slack.com/t/dsformedicine/shared_invite/enQtODA1MDc1NDQ4ODIyLTMzNWFiY2YwYmQ4NDBkYTE5ZWQ0NDQ4YmNiMGE5MmMyYWU5MTkyNjgzMDFiNjdjNjRhYWUwNDJjZThjZmQzZDM).
