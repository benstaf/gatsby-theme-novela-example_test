COVIND is a global registry of COVID-19 individual patient data. It accelerates pooling of high-quality patient data, while ensuring the strongest data protection standards.

### Why COVIND?

A lot of clinical studies about COVID-19 are being published. However, most of them only release aggregated cohort data, **without individual patient data**. This makes secondary data analysis much more difficult. For example:

Clinical outcomes heavily depend on individual patient characteristics, which are **lost by data aggregation**.

For example, these 2 datasets with 2 patients are the same at the aggregated level, but they can still give **different clinical outcomes**:

On the other hand, COVIND database will comprise individual **pseudonymized** data. It will look like:

We also plan to add **CT scans** and other relevant information from electronic health records.

### COVIND use-cases

With COVIND database, we plan to better evaluate **therapies,** such as:

-   Chloroquine
-   Azithromycin
-   Tocilizumab
-   Artemisia
-   Remdesivir…

We also plan to evaluate **interventions** such as:

-   Extra-Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation
-   Invasive Ventilation
-   Helmet Ventilation
-   High-Flow Nasal Cannula…

These projects will rely on the latest **AI and machine learning** technologies, as outlined in [this article](https://melwy.com/blog/coronavirus-therapeutics-real-world-evidence-with-ai-can-deliver-results-faster).

### COVIND is patient-centered

In addition to their **revocable** and **explicit consent**, patients will be able to monitor the impact of their data donation on scientific findings, on a platform suitable for a general audience. This will help them **understand research purposes**. With this pandemic, appetite for research in infectious diseases is growing among the public. Moreover, this platform will facilitate patient **long-term follow-up**.

### COVIND is GDPR-compliant

Data protection is guaranteed by the **European GDPR**, one of the strictest privacy regulations in the world. We can also comply with other local regulations upon request.
