excerpt: Lancet and NEJM retractions are good for open science, here's a timeline of events
---


The latest retractions by the Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine are notable victories for **open science**. These **hoaxes** were more than obscure scientific literature. They had **immediate consequences** on medical practice and policies. These retractions are **not the first scandals** for the [Lancet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lancet#Controversies) and [NEJM](http://ijme.in/articles/the-new-england-journal-of-medicine-commercial-conflict-of-interest-and-revisiting-the-vioxx-scandal/?galley=html), but they are among the most striking. They exposed in broad daylight what happens **when** **science can’t breathe**.

I prepared **timelines** to better understand the sequence of events, and to learn lessons from them. The fraud scheme didn’t start with the Lancet or NEJM publications: earlier, the same gang of fraudsters (Mehra, Patel and Desai) posted an influential **preprint**.

If I forgot something, feel free to ping me on Twitter ([@mostafabenh](https://twitter.com/mostafabenh)), or better, [edit the blog yourself](https://github.com/mostafachatillon/gatsby-theme-novela-example_test/blob/master/content/posts/2020-06-15-timeline/index.mdx) and submit a pull request on GitHub (yes, this blog is open-source).

### Consequences of the frauds

###   

#### The Lancet fraud

###   

-   **22 May**

Publication of the Lancet hoax:

-   **23 May**

**France** minister of health Olivier Veran requests an emergency review of hydroxychloroquine prescription rules:

-   **24 May**

In less than 24 hours, the **French High Council for Public Health** ([@HCSP_fr](https://twitter.com/hcsp_fr)) warns against the “**dangers**” of hydroxychloroquine:

-   **25 May**

The **World Health Organization** suspends its hydroxychloroquine clinical trials:

-   **26 May**

The **Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA)** suspends authorization of hydroxychloroquine use for Covid-19 outside clinical trials.

-   **29 May**

The **United States** terminates relationship with WHO. The Lancet fraud is not officially mentioned, but the **coincidence is striking**, because the Lancet fraud was massively denounced and retweeted by Trump MAGA fans, but still ignored by WHO (see in particular this tweet by [@arkancideisreal](https://twitter.com/Arkancideisreal/status/1264032084944814082) on 23 May to the White House Press Secretary). 
For Trump, that was a unique window of opportunity for a controversial decision.

-   **11 June**

The **Massachusetts Institute of Technology** terminates relationship with **Elsevier** publisher (Lancet owner). The MIT doesn’t mention the latest Lancet fraud, but again, the timing is remarkable.

### The preprint fraud

###   

The first hoax, authored by Patel, Desai, Grainger and Mehra was **not peer-reviewed**. It was a preprint posted on the SSRN server (incidentally, owned by Elsevier, like the Lancet). Nevertheless, it had significant [impact on public health](https://www.isglobal.org/en/healthisglobal/-/custom-blog-portlet/ivermectin-and-covid-19-how-a-flawed-database-shaped-the-covid-19-response-of-several-latin-american-countries/2877257/0) in **Paraguay, Peru and Bolivia**.

-   **6 April**

**First posting** of the preprint on SSRN server (withdrawn from SSRN server since then, but the latest version (19 April) still available at: [http://www.proyectodime.info/documents/219/Utilidad_de_la_ivermectina.pdf](http://www.proyectodime.info/documents/219/Utilidad_de_la_ivermectina.pdf) )

Grainger and Mehra are also co-authors of this hoax.

-   **7 April**

**Paraguay** minister of health, Julio Mazzoleni, restricts sale of **ivermectin**  to **prevent shortages**.

-   **2 May**

[Gustavo Aguirre Chang,](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gustavo-aguirre-chang-5626535b?originalSubdomain=pe) doctor from the San Pablo hospital complex in Lima, Peru, releases a white paper (non peer-reviewed) recommending **ivermectin** to be included in the national COVID-19 treatment guidelines of **Peru**.

-   **8 May**

**Peru** minister of health, Victor M. Zamora Mesia, requests the **inclusion of ivermectin**:

-   **12 May**

**Bolivia** minister of health Marcelo Navajas also **includes ivermectin** in the treatment of patients with coronavirus (COVID-19), under medical protocol and informed consent (**without approval)**.

### The New England Journal of Medicine fraud

###   

The impact of the NEJM fraud is harder to assess at the moment. Authors conclude a “confirmation” that blood pressure drugs angiotensin-converting–enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) were not harmful in the Covid-19 clinical context. It still harmed patients by giving them a **false sense of security**:

### Debunking the frauds

### NEJM publication

###   

Despite **158 citations** on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=4013341607831507270&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en), and a **lot of tweets**, I didn’t find **anyone critical** about this publication, until the Lancet scandal.

### Lancet publication

###   

-   **20 May**

Before publication, fascinating tweets by Lancet editor Richard Horton and hoax author Mandeep Mehra:

I decided to get involved when I saw Mehra refusing to release his data. It was the perfect opportunity for advertising my **new open science platform COVIND,** which relies on open data of Covind-19 patients around the world (learn more: [https://covind.org](https://covind.org)) . Here’s my blog post (read it!):

I didn’t include all critics of the papers, only those who seemed to detect the hoaxes. Again, if I missed anything, ping me on Twitter or submit a PR on GitHub.

### What’s next for open science?

###   

These 3 frauds got 3 different reactions:

-   Lancet: **fast and massive** open review, Twitter trend, open letter, retraction
-   SSRN preprint: **sparse** criticisms, no visible impact
-   NEJM: **nothing** (until the Lancet paper)

Therefore, although the Lancet retraction was a visible success, it only happened after two successful frauds in SSRN and NEJM, which emboldened the Mehra gang of corrupted scientists. That’s far from optimal, open science can achieve much more. I think important questions are:

-   Why did **Peru and Bolivia health authorities** apparently **ignore the few tweets** alerting about SSRN preprint flaws? (although their decisions about ivermectin seem balanced at the end)
-   Why **nobody open-reviewed the NEJM** paper, before the Lancet scandal?

To avoid repeating these mistakes, improvements are needed on two fronts. First, health authorities need to **grow their Twitter-awareness**.

In this area, there are lessons to learn from the US President **Donald Trump**. He benefits from a sophisticated network of **advisors on Twitter**, who inform him in real-time, beyond the swamp of crooked science-bureaucrats.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Ryescc_uPkTlcIqH.jpeg)

On the second front, **open review** capabilities need to be **reinforced**. The NEJM hoax flew under the radar for **more than 3 weeks**, and became a **highly-cited** publication (**158 citations**). How much of this **dark matter** is hiding in the scientific literature? There might be astronomical quantities of **papers** that **nobody reads, everybody cites**, but that are **flawed**.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*MMWMzgm7opKM6oIN.jpeg)

One possible solution is to provide **incentives** for careful reviews. For example, introduce **prizes** for disinfecting the literature. In the Wild West of scientific research, **bounty hunters** can bring order.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*F06skL315sbYD_qa.jpeg)

In conclusion, these 3 scientific frauds show **urgent needs** for **new initiatives** in open science. I launched my own initiative, the COVIND consortium of individual patient data, you are welcome to join at: [https://covind.org](https://covind.org)
